## Overview
This project is a database design and implementation for a Coursera-like online learning platform. It includes entities such as Students, Instructors, Courses, Departments, Offers, Projects, and Certificates, with defined relationships and attributes.

## Project Structure
- **Entities and Attributes**: Detailed in the ER diagram and documentation.

- **Interfaces**: Includes design steps and interfaces for departments, instructors, courses, and offers.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Oracle SQL or a compatible database system installed.
2. Create a new database schema.
3. Run the SQL scripts from `Phase 2_documentation.pdf` to create tables and insert sample data.

## Usage
